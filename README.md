# Intonation
*Intonation patterns in various languages and dialects.*

**Updated:** 8 July 2020

* This repository contains recordings of three sentences in various languages and dialects.
* The aim is to demonstrate a possible typology of intonation patterns of various sentence types.
* The sentences are:
1. I talked to John      (Declarative)
2. Did you talk to John? (Polar (yes-no) question)
3. Who did you talk to?  (wh-question)

* The samples are organized by language family and, when multiple dialects from the same language are available, also by main language (see below).
* The recordings are accompanied by TextGrid files for viewing on Praat. 
* An additional PDF file contains the written and/or phonetic transcriptions of the sentences.

## Notes:
1) The sex of the speaker is indicated in parentheses (F = female, M = male). No other personal demographic information is available.
2) Samples in multiple dialects/languages that were provided by the same speaker are marked with a letter enclosed between sqaure brackets. Each letter is uniquely associated with the speaker.
3) The name 'John' was replaced in some sample by a name that was more appropriate to the phonology or cultural background of the language.

## Limitations:
* Each sample in this repository represents the intonation pattern of a single speaker in a single occasion and should not be taken as representative of the given language/dialect. 
* Limiting factors include:
1. Individual differences (gender, age, style, etc.)
2. Ambiguity: each sentence can be uttered with different intonation patterns, which reflect various factors, such as focus.
3. Extra linguistic factors such as speakerâ€™s mood also affect intonation.
