# Intonation
*Intonation patterns in various languages and dialects.*

* This repository contains recordings of three sentences in various languages and dialects.
* The aim is to demonstrate a possible typology of intonation patterns of various sentence types:

The sentences are:
i) I talked to John   (Declarative)
ii) Did you talk to John?   (Polar (yes-no) question)
iii) Who did you talk to?   (wh-question)

## Notes:
1) The sex of the speaker is indicated in parentheses (F = female, M = male). No other personal demographic information is available.
2) samples in multiple dialects/languages that were provided by the same speaker are marked with a letter enclosed between sqaure brackets. Each letter is uniquely associated with the speaker.

## Limitations:
* Each sample in this repository represents the intonation pattern of a single speaker in a single occasion and should not be taken as representative of the given language/dialect. 
* Limiting factors include:
1. Individual differences (gender, age, style, etc.)
2. Ambiguity: each sentence can be uttered with different intonation patterns, which reflect various factors, such as focus.
3. Extra linguistic factors such as speakerâ€™s mood also affect intonation.
